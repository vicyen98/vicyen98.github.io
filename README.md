ME4101A FYP Project v1.1

Origami is the inspiration for many modern engineering applications including telescopes, solar-sails, transformable architecture, and biomedical devices. The design of such folded mechanisms can be greatly aided by simulation environments where the behavior of a design can be simulated prior to fabrication. The goal of this project is to design a 3D simulator for a special class of patterns known to be rigid-foldable, namely acyclic degree-4-regular crease patterns. The target platform is a Javascript and SVG-based web application.

The platform is partially completed at the end of the final year project (NUS ME4101A), the experiment files that are tested with the platform in the report are stored inside "ORIPA Experiment" under main directory.
